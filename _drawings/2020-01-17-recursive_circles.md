Recursive designs have always facinated me and as someone who works with recursion frequently, I've always wanted to try my hand at it! This image is directly inspired by [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/) which I am slowly working through. My language of choice is `Rust` with which I am using `nannou`. The implementation of this image is directly sourced from a [nannou example](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/blob/master/examples/nature_of_code/chp_08_fractals/8_3_recursion.rs). This tiny project is not an instance of me being original, rather me scratching a surface that I've been interested in for a long time! Please check out [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/) and [nannou example](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/blob/master/examples/nature_of_code/chp_08_fractals/8_3_recursion.rs) as they are both incredible resources!
